# Test-Driven Development (Typescript)

## CASE STUDY
```
Write a program that implements a checkout system for a store.
This program takes a set of products as string ABBDBBAC representing the products on a basket and returns the total amount to pay.
Each product has a fixed price, but some have special discounts.
```

| ITEM     | PRICE    | DISCOUNT  |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| **A**    | 50       | 3 fro 130 |
| **B**    | 30       | 2 fro 45  |
| **C**    | 20       |           |
| **D**    | 15       |           |

### EXAMPLE
1. **AA** >> 100
2. **AABCDADDCD** >> 260
3. **AAABBBCCCDDD** >> 310

## SOLUTION
1. The main branch will have the solution.
2. There are multiple iterations where we apply TDD and we have refactored it
3. We created separate branches starting from iterations 1 to 6.
4. Somebody who wants to give it a try and they can checkout **tdd/iteration-1** to get started
